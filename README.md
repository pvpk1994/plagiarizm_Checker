# plagiarizm_Checker
Checks Plagiarism between any *.c / *.cpp
------------------------------------------

1. Each file in this repository is part of bigger pool of resources, compiling them individually is prohibited.
2. The script files plg_c and plg_cpp run smoothly only when Sim (plagiarism checker) software is downloaded from https://dickgrune.com/Programs/similarity_tester/ website.
3. Each of the files plg_c & plg_cpp.sh have to be installed in the respective directories where you have multiple C/C++ files 
   that are to be compared against one another.
4. The other files percentages.c and pass1.c come from Sim software package. I personally modified those files according to my 
   requirements.
   
   Sample Result Looks like this on running 2 different files that are to be compared.
